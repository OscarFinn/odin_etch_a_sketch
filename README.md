Etch-a-Sketch page in html, css and js for the odin project. Grid size can be adjusted between 1-100 and cells shade darker each time you mouseover. I did not add the rainbow logic.

I would also like to apologise to the commit gods because i wrote all the code and forgot to commit each atomic element.
